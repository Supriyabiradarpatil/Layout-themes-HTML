# Layout-themes-HTML
In Shiny, the layout determines how the various parts of the application are arranged on the page. This is an important part of making the app easy to use and visually appealing. Shiny provides a number of layout functions that help you structure the app, and one of the most commonly used functions is fluidPage(). This function creates a layout that automatically adjusts based on the size of the screen, so it works well on both desktops and mobile devices. Inside fluidPage(), you can use sidebarLayout() to create a layout with a sidebar (where you can place inputs like sliders or text fields) and a main panel (for displaying outputs like plots or tables).

If your app needs multiple sections or "pages", you can use navbarPage() to create a navigation bar at the top with tabs, where each tab can display different content. This is especially useful for organizing a large amount of information. For apps that need a grid-like layout, you can use fluidRow() along with column() to create rows and columns of content, which is great for dashboards or applications with several elements displayed side by side.

HTML Integration
Shiny makes it easy to include HTML content in your app, which helps you customize the design and add more interactive features. You can use Shiny's built-in functions like tags$h1 for headings, tags$p for paragraphs, or tags$img to include images. This is a simple way to add basic HTML elements directly in your app.

Additionally, you can enhance your app's look and feel by adding custom CSS and JavaScript. These files can be placed in a special folder called www and linked inside your app. CSS allows you to control the style of your app, such as changing the colors, fonts, and layout of different elements. JavaScript lets you add interactive features, such as animations or custom behavior. You can also use HTML widgets in Shiny, which are special types of interactive visualizations, such as charts, tables, or maps.

Themes
Shiny comes with a default theme that makes your app look neat and clean. However, you may want to customize the look further. The shinythemes package makes this easy by providing a variety of pre-made themes you can apply to your app. These themes change the colors, fonts, and layout of your app with just a simple command. For example, you can choose themes like cerulean, cosmo, or flatly to change the overall style of your app quickly.
